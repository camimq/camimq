# Hello, how are you? 👋

My name is Camila Queiroz and I'm from São Paulo (🇧🇷). Since 2004, I work in the Tourism & Events industry. I´ve started my carreer on this field, because I´ve always been passionate about connecting people. Through connecting people, ideas are conceived and incredible things happens. I´ve experienced great challenges during my career and I am grateful for all of them.

## And how did I start programming? 💻

At the end of 2019, I´ve decided that I would start my transition to change the path of my career. Technology has always been a passion and I really wanted to turn this into a career. I started studying **Digital Marketing** at Digital House. During this process, I fell in love with **SEO** and all the techniques and technologies involved in the organic positioning process. I dedicated the necessary time to internalize all the acquired knowledge, but I was already focuse on programming.

So, in the beginning of 2021, I´ve started to study programming, also at Digital House. The course is the **Full Stack** program and, since then, I have plunged headlong into this universe. In addition to the class course, I am working in parallel on challenges available online and everything else I can find to solve and build.


But then, if you have already run my repositories, you may be asking: "*And these old repos? Where did they come from?*". Well, this is the record of my first attempt in the programming world, but this is history for another moment!
